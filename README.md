## The idea

A watchlist isn't a list of tickers — it's a list of **theses**. Each item you add
has a one-sentence reason, an entry band, a level that would prove you wrong, and
a catalyst date. A change is only **meaningful** relative to *that* thesis:

- you've entered the entry zone you were waiting for
- price broke your invalidation level (long) or ran through it (short)
- the move is large **for this stock's own volatility** — not a fixed %
- a catalyst is within 5 trading days
- new coverage, a 52-week extreme, a valuation re-rate, an earnings print

When you come back, the app shows a ranked **"While you were away"** digest —
plain-English reasons, per-device "caught up" tracking so your phone and laptop
don't clear each other's badges — and the same feed goes out as a daily email.

## Requirement coverage

| Requirement | Where |
|---|---|
| Create & manage a watchlist | `/watchlist`, `lib/actions/watchlist.actions.ts` — add / remove / edit thesis, named lists, 5 categories with review cadences, search-to-add across **US, NSE and BSE** |
| View latest market information | `lib/market-data/snapshot.ts` — 15-min poll → per-symbol snapshots (price, day %, 52-wk range, P/E, market cap, next earnings, news), routed per venue so Indian listings quote in ₹; TradingView charts on the dashboard and stock pages |
| Return later & see what changed | `lib/changes/detect.ts` (pure, unit-tested engine) + per-device `SeenState` + "While you were away" digest + `Change history` timeline + daily email — see below |

### "Return later and see what changed", in five layers

This is the requirement the whole app is built around, so it's answered more than once:

1. **Before you open it** — the nav badge (`WatchlistNavLink` → `getUnseenCount`) counts unseen events, so you know something moved without loading the page.
2. **What's new since *you* last looked** — the *While you were away* panel. Events are filtered against your `(userId, deviceId, symbol)` watermark, not a fixed window, so it's genuinely "since your last visit" — `You last checked Tuesday at 09:15 — 3h ago · 6 updates across 3 names`.
3. **The literal was → now** — each group carries `deltas`: the last snapshot taken *at or before* your watermark diffed against the current one. `Price $63.86 → $60.14`, `Distance to entry −8.8% → −14.1%`, `P/E`, `Articles (5d)`. Coloured against your thesis direction (a short's drop is green; a widening gap to entry is red even though the number fell).
4. **The full record** — the **History** view (`ChangeHistory`) is the chronological feed over 24h / 7d / 30d / 90d, grouped by day, *including events you've already reviewed*. The digest empties as you triage it; the history never does.
5. **When you don't come back** — the daily Inngest digest email, plus `flagStaleThesesDaily`, which nudges theses you haven't reviewed in a while.

Marking things seen happens two ways: explicitly (`Mark all reviewed` / per-symbol `Reviewed`), and by **actually reading them** — a group counts as read once it has been at least half on screen for 1.5 continuous seconds in a foreground tab. Watermarks only ever move forward (`$max`), so two devices can't hide events from each other. A brand-new device is seeded from your furthest-along device (`ensureSeenBaseline`) instead of replaying three weeks of history you already triaged on your laptop.

### Design decisions

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What counts as a meaningful change | Relative to your thesis, scored 0–100 — see the table in `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| State across sessions / devices | Server-side `(userId, deviceId, symbol)` watermarks, monotonic `$max` updates |
| Stale / delayed / conflicting data | `source` + `asOf` + `stale` on every snapshot; intraday-move alerts gated on market hours; `unconfirmedFields` when two provider endpoints disagree |
| Scale | Ingestion deduped across users (one fetch per symbol), append-only TTL-bounded snapshot series, materialized change feed — page loads never hit the data provider |
| Simple vs. complex | One ~200-line detection module, Inngest + Mongo TTL indexes instead of a separate scheduler/queue, no websockets (15-min grain is right for a *watchlist*) |

## Tech stack

Versions are what's installed, not what's aspirational.

| Choice | Why it's here | What it costs |
|---|---|---|
| **Next.js 15.5** · **React 19** | Server actions put the data layer and the UI in one codebase — no REST layer to keep in sync with yourself on a solo build | Ties you to a Node host |
| **TypeScript 5.9**, strict | The engine passes snapshots between twelve modules; strict typing is what made renaming and splitting them safe | Slower to write |
| **MongoDB 8** + **Mongoose** | Snapshots are semi-structured documents from an API whose shape we don't control, and TTL indexes gave bounded retention for free | For users and watchlist rows, Postgres would fit better |
| **Inngest 3** | Scheduled jobs with retries, step-level visibility and a one-line concurrency cap, without running our own worker | A third party in the critical path |
| **Better Auth 1.7.3** | Email and Google in one library, with account linking. Upgraded from 1.3.7 to clear security advisories | Younger than the alternatives |
| **Tailwind 4** + Radix | One file of design tokens, no stylesheet drift across 60 components | Noisy markup |
| **`node --test`** | Ships with Node and reads TypeScript directly — 142 tests, zero test dependencies | No coverage report out of the box |

**Data sources.** Finnhub for US listings (9 endpoints, free tier is enough).
A keyless public endpoint for NSE and BSE, because Finnhub returns a null price
for every Indian listing on this plan. Frankfurter for exchange rates. Gemini
and Nodemailer for the written digest — both optional.

**Seven collections**: `watchlist` (the thesis), `snapshots` (time series),
`watchedsymbols` (refcount + cached latest), `symbolevents` (shared across
watchers), `changeevents` (per user), `seenstates` (per-device watermarks),
`thesisrevisions` (your own edit history). Every one that grows with time has a
TTL.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Node 20+ (uses native TS type-stripping for tests) and a MongoDB
you can reach — a local `mongod` or a free Atlas cluster.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env       # fill in the four required values below
npm run dev                # → http://localhost:3000
```

Only **four** variables are required. Everything else is optional and the app
degrades cleanly without it (see *Running with less* below).

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `MONGODB_URI` | local `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/watchlist`, or an Atlas connection string |
| `FINNHUB_API_KEY` | free key at [finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io) |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` |

Then: **sign up → `/watchlist` → "Load demo watchlist" → "Simulate while you were
away"**. That runs the real detection engine over synthetic prices, so the digest
lights up immediately — no waiting for market hours, and it works even before the
background poll has captured any history.

To exercise the scheduled poll and the digest cron, run the Inngest dev server in
a second terminal (optional):

```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

### Verify your install

These two need **no `.env`, no database and no network** — the change engine is a
pure function, so you can validate the core of the app before configuring
anything:

```bash
npm test          # 12 change-engine cases
npx tsc --noEmit  # strict typecheck
```

This one needs `MONGODB_URI` set (Next collects page data at build time, which
touches the DB layer). It fails with `MONGODB_URI must be set within .env` if you
run it too early:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running with less

| Missing | What happens |
|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `SECRET` | "Continue with Google" is hidden; email/password still works |
| `NODEMAILER_*` | No emails sent. Password-reset links print to the **server console** (`[reset-password] link for …`) so the flow is still testable |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Welcome email uses static copy; the optional daily *news* summary is skipped (the watchlist digest is unaffected — it needs no LLM) |
| Inngest not running | No background poll; the in-app **Refresh** button fetches on demand |
| `FINNHUB_API_KEY` | Search returns nothing and snapshots are written with `source: finnhub:no-quote` + `stale: true`, so the UI marks the data delayed instead of showing invented numbers |

Full `.env` reference:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

FINNHUB_API_KEY=            # https://finnhub.io  (or NEXT_PUBLIC_FINNHUB_API_KEY)
MONGODB_URI=                # local mongod or MongoDB Atlas

BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=         # any long random string
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# optional — "Continue with Google" (button appears automatically once both are set)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=          # console.cloud.google.com → OAuth client
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=      # redirect URI: <BETTER_AUTH_URL>/api/auth/callback/google

# optional — emails (welcome, daily digest, password-reset link)
GEMINI_API_KEY=
NODEMAILER_EMAIL=
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_FROM="Stock Watchlist <no-reply@localhost>"
```

**Auth:** email/password + optional Google OAuth. "Forgot password" works out of the
box — with email configured the reset link is mailed; without it, the link is
printed to the server console so you can still test the flow.

### Try it

Sign in → **/watchlist** → **Load demo watchlist** → **Simulate "while you were
away"**. The simulate button runs the real detection engine on synthetic prices
so the digest lights up regardless of market hours or whether you have an API key.

## Tests

```bash
npm test        # 142 tests, node:test — no database, no network
```

There are 142 and not a dozen because **the whole core is pure**. Twelve modules
in `lib/changes/` take data and return data — no database, no network, no clock
unless it's injected — so a test is three object literals and an assertion.

| Module | Decides | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `changes/detect.ts` | what changed — 14 event types | 17 |
| `changes/explain.ts` | why an event ranks where it does | 13 |
| `changes/confidence.ts` | how much to trust a quote; provider self-contradiction | 12 |
| `changes/coverage.ts` | whether silence can honestly be reported as quiet | 12 |
| `changes/concentration.ts` | sector concentration, currency-safe | 11 |
| `changes/health.ts` | how the list as a whole is doing | 10 |
| `changes/exchange.ts` | venue, market hours and currency per ticker | 9 |
| `changes/parse-thesis.ts` | pulling levels out of a pasted sentence | 9 |
| `changes/currency.ts` · `preferences.ts` · `revision.ts` | conversion · filtering · thesis diffs | 24 |
| `changes/display.ts` | shared formatting | 6 |
| `market.ts` | US trading days and hours | 10 |
| `observability/logger.ts` | redaction of secret-shaped values | 5 |
| `watchlist/export.ts` | CSV escaping | 4 |

I/O lives at the edges: one pipeline module, the server actions, the models.
The honest gap is that the React layer is verified by hand, not by test.
